# 🧬 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on diagnostic measurements and personal health information. It applies various machine learning models and evaluates their performance to identify the most accurate approach.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships
- Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, scale features, encode if needed)
- Train and compare multiple ML classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve
- Identify the most influential health features for predicting diabetes

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 768 samples with 8 input features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

The target variable is:
- `Outcome` → 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost (optional)

## 📈 Results Summary

The best-performing model was [Model Name] with an accuracy of **XX%**. Glucose and BMI were among the top predictors of diabetes.
